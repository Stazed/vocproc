VocProc
=======

VocProc is a LV2 plugin for pitch shifting, vocoding, automatic pitch correction
and harmonization of singing voice.


Building
========

Dependencies:
  -  gtkmm-2.4
  -  lv2-c++-tools http://ll-plugins.nongnu.org/hacking.html  
        (requires libboost for building)
  -  fftw3

On Ubuntu/Debian dev packages are needed (libgtkmm-2.4-dev, libboost-dev, libfftw3-dev).

Compilation:
> make
> make install

Uninstalation:
> make uninstall


To vocode or not to vocode?
Because of its builtin vocoder functionality VocProc has two inputs (voice and carrier)
and one output. In Ardour, a plugin with two inputs can only be added (AFAIK) to stereo 
tracks, which leaves an empty channel if vocoder is not used.
Because of that it is possible to build VocProc without vocoder functionality by editing
the Makefile (instructions are at the top of the file).


Usage
=====

User interface consists of four sections: pitch shifter, formant correction / 
vocoder, info about difference between wanted and current tone and automatic 
pitch correction. 

Pitch shifting section allows manual pitch shifting of input signal in range 
from octave down (-12 semitones) to octave up (12 semitones). Also included is 
effect slider for adding simple effect to input signal. Effect is turned on by
setting slider to any value other than zero. If value is low, effect will produce
metallica and robotic sound. For higher values sound will be a bit like whispering.

Formant correction / vocoder section can be used to preserve formant structure 
while pitch shifting (timbre preservation) or to add vocoder style effect to 
input signal (signal input named carrier is used for second signal source - 
synth or anything else). 

Offset section shows offset from current tone to wanted tone. If middle (of three)
section is filled then offset is shown from -100 to 100 cents. Else, offset is
out of that range.

Automatic pitch correction section allows automatic correction of pitch of input 
signal. Default behaviour can be modified using three sliders and two dropdown
menus (for choosing key and scale mode). Threshold determines how much input 
signal has to be off scale to apply pitch correction. Attack acts like portamento
- if it is set to zero correction will be applied immediately and if it is set to
some higher value pitch factor will gradually glide to correct value. Transpose 
allows transposition (application can be used as a harmonizer).
